How to use ?

Once you add the .gpl file in this repository to `/home/myname/.config/inkscape/palettes` folder, you will get access to colour palette in Inkscape ( you need to select it from the arrow based menu ) for Ubuntu.

As for Windows 10, you can use `C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\palettes`<br>

Mac users might find  `~/inkscape/palettes` useful
